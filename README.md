# ASF-Netbeans-MacOSX-packager

If you need a ready to download and use netbeans.app for MacOS, I have created a #MacOS package to run #NetBeans natively. The package is available on #GitHub from this link: https://github.com/Webbiefourth/Apache-Netbeans-9.0-MacOSX â€¦

Some people may want to create their own MacOS package, for v9.0 or any future versions. The ASF-Netbeans-MacOSX-packager https://github.com/Webbiefourth/ASF-Netbeans-MacOSX-packager is just created for that.

Now you can package and run Apache Netbeans on MacOS natively.

Enjoy!
